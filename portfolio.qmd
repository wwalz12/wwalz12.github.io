## Case Study: BK Capital (July 2025)

**Title:** The Quantifiable Rise of Behavioral Trading in NVIDIA’s AI Bubble

This past summer, I conducted an independent case study using financial data from Yahoo Finance investigate the shifting drivers of NVIDIA's stock performance. The study analyzed whether the "AI Hype" era (Post-2022) created a regime shift where narrative momentum (sentiment) overpowered traditional fundamentals.

### Study 1: Daily Return Prediction Models
I compared ten regression specifications to determine which variables best explained NVIDIA's daily returns from January to June 2025. The analysis found that sentiment, proxied by **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**, was a consistent predictor of short-term price movements which usually outweighed valuation metrics.

The chart below compares the R-squared values across models. The **"RSI_L1"** model (RSI with a 1-day lag) achieved the highest explanatory power ($R^2 = 0.591$) which suggests that yesterday's sentiment is the strongest signal for today's price action.

The RSI_L1 model (0.591) outperforms the base model (0.551), indicating the predictive superiority of lagged sentiment.](assets/image.png){fig-alt="Bar chart showing R-squared values for 10 regression models.

### Study 2: Earnings Surprise Regime Shift
To test for behavioral divergence I used a Logit model to predict the probability of a positive stock move after an earnings announcement. I compared the Pre-2022 era against the Post-2022 "AI Bubble" era.

As shown in **Figure 3**, the relationship changed. The **Post-2022 curve (Red)** is steeper and shifts left compared to **Pre-2022 (Blue)**. This indicates a "hair-trigger" market where even small positive surprises sharply increase the probability of a rally, although the statistical reliability of fundamentals actually declined. Earnings calls have less impact on price action than they did previously. This confirms a regime shift; narrative momentum now trumps traditional earnings logic, at least for AI-centric tickers like NVIDIA.
